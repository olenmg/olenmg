## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I want to challenge myself to develop future-oriented technologies by collaborating with people from various backgrounds and fields. I am mainly interested in Reinforcement learning, Deep learning, Computational neuroscience, and Brain-inspired AI, while I am also open to exploring a variety of other intriguing fields. I always pursue interdisciplinary convergence and enjoy it much.
