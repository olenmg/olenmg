## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am excited about the opportunity to work on future-oriented technologies through collaboration with people from various backgrounds and fields. My primary interest is Reinforcement Learning, though I am also open to exploring a wide array of other intriguing fields, especially diverse aspects of Software Engineering. I have always been drawn to interdisciplinary convergence and find it highly rewarding. I am eager to expand my understanding across its many facets while contributing to meaningful projects.
